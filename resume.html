Some of my key experiences include my work with CBC on the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics, and my documentary experience on both "Nobody Cares, Work Harder" and "Shiftmaker".I am originally from Ottawa, and currently live in Toronto for school. One of my favourite hobbies is music, both playing piano and guitar, listening to music, and collecting vinyl records. My full resume can be seen below.</p>
